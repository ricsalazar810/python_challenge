# python_challenge
This is my module 3 challenge repository.

In this repo, the code for both PyBank and PyPoll will both be found in their respective folders.

Each folder has the analysis saved in the analysis folder.

For the PyBank section, I used datetime class from datetime module: https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html
For the PyPoll section, I used .get function: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-get-unique-values-list/
